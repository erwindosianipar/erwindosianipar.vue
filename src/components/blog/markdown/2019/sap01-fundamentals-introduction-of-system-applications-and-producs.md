Fundamentals Introduction of System Applications and Producs. In my college we have study this sytem for increase of how to make a complete system when we build a one of information system, so we must know concept of the system information before we build it :)

### SAP's Company History

In 1972, SAP was founded by five former IBM employees in Germany. Their vision is to create a standard enterprise software system that can integrate all business processes in real time. The first product released was the R / 1 financial accounting software (R stands for "real-time data processing").

Then in the 1980s to 1990, SAP issued R / 2 based on mainframes. In 1999 SAP released Client / Server-based R / 3 which was multiplatfom both Microsoft and Unix.

At present SAP is used by more than 12 million users, and 121,000 installations have been installed in 41,200 companies and government agencies in 120 countries.

### SAP's Uses

SAP has several modules, and each module has its own functions and uses, along with a list of modules and their functions in SAP.

#### SD - Sales & Distribution

Help improve the efficiency of operational activities related to the process of managing customer orders (sales, shipping and billing processes).

#### MM - Materials Management

Help run the procurement process (procurement) and inventory management.

#### PP - Production Planning

Help the planning and control process rather than the production activities (manufacturing) of a company.

#### FI - Financial Accounting

Includes accounting standards for cash management (treasury), general ledger, account payable, account receivable and consolidated for financial reporting purposes.

#### CO - Controlling

Includes cost accounting, starting from cost center accounting, cost element accounting, and profitability analysis.

Implementing SAP in an organization will integrate the system which results in:
Changes made to one module will automatically update the other modules if the changed information is related to that module. Data will be updated directly as soon as the user inputs data into the system. This is known as "real-time processing".

System integration can occur on the condition that all companies must use the same data source, both for customer data, product data and vendor data.

### The Purpose of SAP's

Data transparency - All users who have access to the system will be able to see all the most up-to-date information whenever needed even if the information is input by other users.
